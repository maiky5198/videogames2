# Cat and Mouse
I want to create a cat and mouse game where the cat gets faster the longer you are playing.

ï¿¼[WireFrame](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOLx4qdQ=/?invite_link_id=574983357630)

Within the wireframe works you'll see that theres a powerup gabagool and cheese block that slows down the cat.
Also a time ticker since this game is surviving based.

There is no winning just highscore, that pops up after dying
